### JVM
JVM is a program that provides the runtime environment necessary for Java programs to execute. Java programs cannot run unless there is a JVM available for the appropriate hardware and OS platform we wish to execute on.
- When JVM takes in a Java program for execution, the program is not provided as Java language source code. Instead, the Java language source must have been converted into Java bytecode.
- The JVM is an interpreter for the bytecode form.
_Bytecode is not machine code, it's a halfway house between source code and machine code_
